# Inventory_Management_System_Invigo_using_JAVA
This project is developed using Java Swing with MySQL as the database. Before running this project, please ensure that MySQL is installed on your PC. Additionally, download the required dependencies. Note that the folder contains some Apache Derby JAR files, which are not used in this project. Initially, I attempted to use Apache Derby, but compatibility issues with the latest JDK and Derby DB versions led me to switch to MySQL.

Important Notes:
The latest version includes password encryption.
Updates have been made to the Order page.
For a detailed understanding, please refer to the project report.
